Uma Musume game module.

This package provides Uma Musume-specific functionality.
Uma Musume has special event types:
- Champions Meeting (multi-phase competitive event)
- Legend Race (character-specific racing event)
- Gacha banners
- Story events

Note: This is a stub module. The full implementation will be migrated
from uma_module.py and uma_handler.py.
