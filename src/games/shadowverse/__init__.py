Shadowverse game module.

This package provides Shadowverse-specific functionality.
Shadowverse events are organized by class (Sword, Dragon, etc.)
and include:
- Grand Prix tournaments
- Story events
- Card pack releases
- Collaboration events

Note: This is a stub module. The full implementation will be migrated
from shadowverse_handler.py.
